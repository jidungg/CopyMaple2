\section compile Compiling the Library

Starting with version 0.5, Niflib creates a lib file that is too large to distribute directly, so to use it through C++ you must first compile it.  If you need help to do this, there is information about it on our main website here:  <a href="http://www.niftools.org/wiki/index.php/Niflib/Compile">Compiling Niflib</a>.

A Python compile of the library will still be available for Windows, but for other platforms you will need to compile the library yourself.

\section include Including the Library

\subsection cpp C++

Once you have compiled Niflib, you will have a binary library file which you must reference from your project.  If you�re using Visual Studio, you can add it as an �Additional Dependancy� within your project options.  You can also include all the source code in your compile process if you do not want to use an intermediate library file. Finally, make sure the path to niflib.h is in your include search paths. 

\code
#include "niflib.h"
\endcode

There are now separate include files for each object type in a NIF file.  To include the NiNode object, for example, include the obj/NiNode.h file like so:

\code
#include "obj/NiNode.h"
\endcode

You will have one such line in your source code for each NIF object that your program needs access to.

Niflib also wraps all its functions in the "Niflib" namespace.  So, depending on your needs, you can either gain access to all Niflib symbols with a using directive like this:

\code
using namespace Niflib;
\endcode

Gain access to specific symbols but not others with specific using directives like this:

\code
using Niflib::NiNodeRef;
using Niflib::NiObjectRef;
using Niflib::ReadNifTree;
\endcode

Or simply prepend all of your Niflib symbols with "Niflib::" like this:

\code
Niflib::NiObjectRef niObj = Niflib::ReadNifTree( "test.nif" );
\endcode

\subsection py Python

If you are using the pre-compiled version of the Python SWIG wrapper for Windows, you should follow the instructions in the readme file that is included. Briefly, you will place the _niflib.dll and the niflib.py files in your Python 2.4 install location. If you want to compile them yourself you will need to get SWIG 1.3.25 or higher. There there are two build methods, Scons and a Visual Studio 2005 project, provided for this purpose.

Once you have these files in the proper position in the Python directory, you can use the library in either of the two standard Python ways:

\code
from niflib import *
\endcode
or
\code
import niflib
\endcode

To save space, the examples assume that you have used the first method. Of course if you use the second, you will have to preface all function calls with niflib. For example, ReadNifTree() becomes niflib.ReadNifTree().  Currently the Python module includes all NIF objects and is not split into separate modules for each object like the C++ version, so you will only need a single import statement to get everything.

\section exept Exceptions

Niflib uses C++ exceptions rather than error return codes. These are a lot more convenient in that you don�t have to wrap every single function in an if-test, but not everyone understands what they are, so I thought I�d provide enough of an intro to get you along. C++ exceptions should be mapped to Python exceptions transparently, so this only applies to people using the library via C++.

Very basically, if you want to check if Niflib function calls are failing, and why, wrap them in a try block like this:

\code
try {
    //Niflib Function Call
    vector<NiObject> objects = ReadNifList( current_file );
}
catch( exception & e ) {
    cout << "Error: " << e.what() << endl;
    return 0;
}
catch( ... ) {
    cout << "Unknown Exception." << endl;
    return 0;
}
\endcode

The really nice thing about exceptions is that you can place all of your Niflib calls within one try block, and if any one of them fails, execution will jump to the catch block. The first block will catch any exception thrown explicitly by Niflib, and an error message can be extracted and printed. Other exceptions, such as from bugs in the library or errors it never occurred to us to test for, will go to the second block which is a catch-all statement that will end your program for any other reason.

There are ways to recover from exceptions, but this should be enough to allow you to at least exit gracefully if a function signals an error.

\section stl_temp STL & Templates

Niflib makes quite a bit of use of the standard template library, and also includes some templates of its own. You should be familiar with the template syntax for defining variables (ex: template<type>) You should also be familiar with at least the following STL built-in types: string, vector, and list. These types map to Python types seamlessly (string, tuple, and tuple respectively), so no understanding of C++ is required for Python users.

\section file_basics NIF File Basics

NIF files are the result of the NetImmmerse/Gamebryo engine saving the current state of a scene graph.  A scene graph is a tree of 3D transforms that has meshes and rendering instructions attached.  Each object is a class which, when the file is saved, writes its contents to disk.  So the NIF file is a listing of all the NIF classes, or objects, that are required to recreate a particular scene.

The objects in a NIF file all inherit from the NiObject class and reference eachother in various ways.  These relationships are reconstructed when the file is loaded from disk and can then be broken or redirected.  The most important structure is formed by the scene graph objects.  These objects inherit from the NiAVObject class and form the spacial structure of the scene represented by the NIF file.  Each has a 3D transform that is relative to its parent.

Attatched to the NiAVObject classes are various other sorts of objects that either contain the raw data used to render the scene, such as the verticies in NiTriBasedGeomData and the animation keyframes in NiKeyFrameData, or modify the way the scene is drawn in some other way such as objects inheriting from NiProperty and NiExtraData.

Each object type has member functions which allow you to get and set data, adjust linkage to other objects, and some also include functions to perform useful calculations on the data.

You do not access the classes directly, however.  Niflib uses reference counting to determine when objects are destroyed, so you always access a class through a Ref smart pointer.  This is a template which takes the class as its template argumetn, such as Ref<NiNode>.  For each type of Ref a typedef has been provided in the form of [class name]Ref, so Ref<NiNode> has the typedef NiNodeRef, and this name can be used instead of the more unusual template syntax.  When the last Ref smart pointer that points to a particular object is reassigned or goes out of scope, that object will take care of cleaning itself up automatically.

Objects use Ref smart pointers internally as well, so you don�t have to worry about objects that are referenced by other objects destroying themselves unexpectedly.


\section rw_files Reading and Writing NIF Files

To check whether a file is really a NIF file, call the CheckNifVersion() function. You can then call the IsSupportedVersion() function to determine whether the data in the file may not be well understood.  There are two ways to read in a NIF file � as a list of objects in the order they appear in the file and as a single Ref pointing to the root of the scene graph tree from which all other objects can be found by following the links between objects.  Most of the time you will probably want to use the tree method, as this is the only one eligible for writing.  The list method is provided for uses such as Niflyze that need to retrieve all objects, regardless of whether we fully understand the links that keep them from destroying themselves.  Unsupported objects may not be included in the tree representation if no other objects reference them.  So most of the time, you�re going to want to call the ReadNifTree() function.

That�s all there is to reading in a NIF file.  If all goes well with the reading process (no exception was thrown), you will have at least one NIF object in memory � the root object of the tree.  You can pass this same object to the WriteNifTree() function to create a new NIF file from the representation in memory.

WARNING:  Some features of the NIF format are still unsupported by Niflib, therefore in some cases the exported NIF may either be different from the original, or completely unusable.  DO NOT OVERWRITE THE ORIGINAL NIF FILE.

\section work_blk Working with NIF Objects

New class objects don�t have to just come from loaded NIF files.  To create an object yourself, you can do so by using the C++ new keyword like so:

\code
RefNiNode node = new NiNode;
\endcode

It is recommended to always use smart pointers, rather than plain pointers, to ensure that your object is not destroyed before you realize it.  So do NOT do this:

\code
NiNode * node = new NiNode;
\endcode

All NIF objects inherit from NiObject so a good place to start would be understanding the methods of that class.

You can access the member functions of any class through a Ref smart pointer of the right type by using the -> operator.  In Python you will need to use the Ref::Ptr() function as an intermediary between a smart reference and the object that it holds, like so:

\code
//C++
niNode->GetChildren;

#Python
niNode.Ptr().GetChildren()
\endcode

If you have a Ref of one type, such as a generic NiObjectRef, and you want to know if the object it points to also inherits from the NiNode class, you use the DynamicCast() template function.  To cast from a NiObjectRef to a NiNodeRef, you would do the following:

\code
NiObjectRef root = ReadNifTree( �test.nif� );
NiNodeRef node = DynamicCast<NiNode>( root );
if ( node != NULL ) {
   ...
\endcode

Note the template syntax of the DynamicCast() function.  In Python these tempates are mapped to functions named DynamicCastTo[object type]().  For example, DynamicCastToNiNode().  To use them you must use the Ref::Ptr() function as they expect pointers rather than references.  For example:

\code
root = ReadNifTree( �test.nif� );
node = DynamicCastToNiNode( root.Ptr() );
if root != NULL:
   ...
\endcode

Notice also that you must always check the value returned by DynamicCast().  If the cast is not successful, i.e. the object is not a derived type of the one you�re trying to cast it to, the function will return NULL.

Casting down the inheritance tree should be automatic in C++, but you can also explicitly call the StaticCast() function.  You will need to use this function to cast a Ref to the type expected by some member functions which take Ref arguments.

One useful function of all NIF objects is the NiObject::asString() function.  You can use it to get an English summary of the contents of that object.  You can also call the NiObject::GetIDString() function to get a short readout that includes the memory address, type, and name, if any, of the object.

You will probably also want to know the type of a block at some point.  You can retrieve this with the NiObject::GetType() function.  This returns a reference to the Type value that uniquly identifies this class.  You can get its name by calling the Type::GetTypeName() function.
